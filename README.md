Busybox is a mostly Python description for a FreeCAD model to do a FEM analysis on a bookshelf design.

To buld the model, start FreeCAD and then run the macros in the order of their 3 digit sequence number.  Item 4, also called busybox_004_body.FCMacro, may be run as many as 6 consecutive times.

The last step, busybox_006_mirror.FCMacro, takes several minutes to run.

At the end of the process, there should be a cartoon of a bookshelf, with 1 joist representing each shelf.  The center of each joist has a load platform where the FEM environment can apply force.

This model does not cut out the passageways for the support member.  I do not know if that interferes with the FEM analysis or not.  Also, the model does not use any gaps between the structural members.
